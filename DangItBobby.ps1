# Description: This script searches for a specific, logged on user on all or 
# specific Computers by checking the process "explorer.exe" and its owner. It 
# then enumerates the list and lets you choose a PC to disable the NIC on. Useful
# as a last-resort script to stop a ransomware infection in-progress.
