# UsefulPowershell
An assortment of useful (and useless!) Powershell scripts I've written and am willing to share.


### AssaultOnHoth.ps1 ###
A Powershell GUI form to query for all domains in your forest and present you with fields to complete. 
This is very much a work in progress though it will slow down for a while if I get distracted by something else (OOH! SHINEY!!)
This is also my first foray in to the world of PSForms so any feedback is welcome.

* Includes AOH_symbol.ico and AOH_background.jpg


### IpInfo.ps1 ###
Get the public IP address of the machine this is run on and send it as an email or place a text file somewhere.


### ThirtySevenFlairs.ps1 ###
Queries your domain for any DFSR locations then builds a report (display or email output) with the backlog.
